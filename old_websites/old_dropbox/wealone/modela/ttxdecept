Attention students and poor people : you probably qualify for free state and federal filing through TurboTax. To access this, you must brave a maze of dark, twisted web forms, and avoid several points-of-no-return.

These states qualify you for free online state filing, for typical student income ranges ( less than 31K ) : 
[ AL, AR, AZ, GA, IA, ID, IN, KY, MI, MN, MO, MS, NY, NC, ND, OK, OR, RI, SC, VA, VT, WV ].

To file for FREE federal AND state returns via TurboTax, you must use the Freedom edition, NOT the "Free" edition. The Freedom edition lies at http://turbotax.intuit.com/taxfreedom/ and must not be confused with the "Free" edition.

Cavears : 

You must NOT file your Free federal online return through TurboTax, as this will prevent you from using the "Freedom" edition for state. I would suggest NOT making an account with TurboTax, as once a particular product is selected, it becomes impossible to downgrade without creating a separate, new account. Deferring registration until the last minute ensures that you will not accidentally be caught in this trap via mis-clicks and confusion. However, if you use this method, note that unregistered accounts time out after 20 minutes and you must start over. Alternatively, if you have not initated any other TurboTax product this year, you can proceed to fill out the Freedom edition with a registed account, just don't accidentally upgrade, or accidentally file the "Free" edition instead of the "Freedom" edition. It seems like you can make one new account for each email, so if you have N email addresses you can make N-1 accidental upgrades. TurboTax, despite its advertised purpose of minimizing the cost of doing taxes, will not inform you automatically if you qualify for the Freedom edition.

If you do not qualify for the Freedom edition, you can still file your federal return online for free, with care. Avoid accidentally upgrading to either "Basic" or "Delux" packages, and stay on the "Free" package. Once you click into the "Basic" or "Delux" branches, you cannot return to the "Free" branch without making a new account. TurboTax will "helpfully" automatically prepare your state form at the same time. However, once you go to file, you will not be able to submit the "Free" federal form without also paying for the state form. However, it is possible to take notes on the automated state tax form, and then go back in the process and DELETE your state tax return. This will allow you to file your free federal online return, and also give you some clues for filing your state return by hand. Note that, if you do choose to file your free federal return, you will be unable to return and use any other TurboTax product this year. This means that you will be unable to file your "Freedom" free state tax return later, even if you qualify.

Points of trickery : 
-- nondisclosure of free state and federal "Freedom" version
-- inability to return to Free after accidentally forking to Basic or Delux editions
-- -- failure to disclose aforementioned deception
-- inability to file Free federal return without deleting automatically generated state return
-- -- failure to disclose aforementioned deception
-- inability to file Freedom free state return after completing Free federal online return
-- failure to disclose aforementioned deception
