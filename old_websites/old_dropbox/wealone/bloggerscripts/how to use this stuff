generate:

Take post metadata and build summary navigation website
cat th_posts.txt | ./justposts.py | ./blogstat.py | ./generate.py

blogstat:

dont know what it does but is part of the generate usage pipeline
something about geting author metadata from a blogger post

cached_invoke

something for saving operations to disk

blogcrawl

looks on a blogger website, print all it finds to STDOUT
this seems to cache itself so I guess that never was finished
you have to clear the caches if you want it to actually locate new
material. one suggestion is to cache ONLY POST links.

blogcrawl.py | ./justposts.py | ./blogstat.py | ./generate.py

justposts

this can tell which links are from posts and which are not from a 
blogger link, part of the generate pipeline
