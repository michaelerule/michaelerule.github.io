cyto.math.complex
    representation and functions on complex numbers, complete with a parser and
    evaluator. I wrote the parser in high school so it has some bugs with minus
    signes. 

overview of classes contained :

Complex
    a representation of compelx numbers and several functions which act on them
    
ComplexVarList
    A represenation of one character variables used by the parser

ConstantEvaluation
    A represenation of lookingup a constant for the parser/evaluator

Equation
    A representaiton of an equation in complex numbers
  
EquationFormatter
    A text field formatter which accepts valid equations in complex numbers.

EvaulationOperaion
    Abstract interface for an evaluation step
  
ExpressionFormatter
    A text field formatter which accepts valed expressions in the complex n
    numbers

FunctionEvaluation
    A representation of function evualtion for the evaluator/parser

IteratedEquationFormatter
    Probably meant for a fractol program from a whlie ago

MathToken
    the parser

Operation
    abstract representation of a function call
    
OperationEvaluation
    represents binary operations for the parser

VariableEvaluation
    repreents variable lookup for the parser
