Problem: I accidentally deleted everything.
Ideally: roll back versions.
Problem: this is considered dangerous with github

Solution:

Merge correct branch into master via overwriting
Switch to master
Merge correct branch back in with master?

git checkout branch-name
git merge --strategy=ours master    # keep the content of this branch, but record a merge
git checkout master
git merge branch-name            # fast-forward master up to the merge
